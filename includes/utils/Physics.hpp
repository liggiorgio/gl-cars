/*
Physics class - v1:
- initialization of the physics simulation using the Bullet librarty

The class sets up the collision manager and the resolver of the constraints, using basic general-purposes methods provided by the library. Advanced and multithread methods are available, please consult Bullet documentation and examples

createRigidBody method sets up a  Box or Sphere Collision Shape. For other Shapes, you must extend the method.
